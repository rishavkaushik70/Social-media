* **State Management:** Uses React Context API (`useContext`) for global state management across components, avoiding prop drilling.
* **Responsive UI:** Clean and responsive user interface with Loading states and empty-data fallbacks (Welcome Messages).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/rishavkaushik70/Social-Media.git](https://github.com/rishavkaushik70/Social-Media.git)

"Note: This project currently uses the DummyJSON API for backend simulation. The 'Create Post' feature successfully executes POST requests and actions, but since DummyJSON does not persist data, new posts will not reflect on the Home feed upon redirect. Full CRUD functionality will be visible once the custom backend is integrated."
